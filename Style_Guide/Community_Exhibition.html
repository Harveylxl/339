    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Community Exhibition is a local art space located in the lobby of the new Vancouver Art Gallery. The space
      displays outstanding works by BC artists on different themes each month. Local artists can submit their artworks
      online that fit the monthly theme. The top 10 works voted for will be displayed in the Gallery's lobby for one
      month. ​</p>
    <h2>Ethnography</h2>
    <h3>Data collection</h3>
    <h4>Interview</h4>
    <p>We interviewed visitors about their visit to the gallery, how often they visited, and different ways they
      accessed information about the current exhibitions.</p>
    <h4>Online Survey</h4>
    <p>An online survey was created to gather additional quantitative information about people’s experiences when they
      previously visited.</p>
    <h4>Zoom Meeting</h4>
    <p>We did a group interview with Vancouver Art Gallery’s Director of Strategic Communications & Branding and
      Director of Publishing & Content Strategy.</p>

    <h2>Design Focus</h2>
    <h3>How might we create a sense of community and identity within the Vancouver Art Gallery that can be felt by
      regular and first-time visitors?</h3>

    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Because our research insight is centred on promoting exhibition marketing, our main targeted audience is frequent
      visitors with experience in artistic creation and first-time visitors. </p>

    <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
    <p>Muhan Huang assumed the responsibility of designing the journey map, while other team members contributed to the
      content creation. Based on our previous research and our personas, I responsible for mapping out the journey they
      may go through before,
      during and after their visit at Vancouver Art Gallery.</p>

    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p>Terrence Xu took the role of developing the storyboard. He presented a visually captivating narrative that
      revolves around the journey of an artist and the exploration of local artwork by a visitor.</p>

    <h2>Participatory Workshop</h2>
    <p>The workshop was led by Andy, with collaborative content creation from all team members. The objective of this
      workshop was to bring together individuals from diverse roles and engage in intensive exploration and discussion
      to generate potential solutions.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>After completing the initial mockup, I used Figma to create a prototype with the most important process for user
      testing. This process allows us to step back and understand the user experience as a beginner. I updated the
      submission page of Community Exhibition based on feedback from potential users to provide a more user-friendly
      interface for artists to submit their work.</p>
