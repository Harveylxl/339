    <h2>Ethnography</h2>
    <h3>Data collection</h3>
    <h4>Interview</h4>
    <p>We interviewed visitors about their visit to the gallery, how often they visited, and different ways they
      accessed
      information about the current exhibitions. We in-person interviewed 15 visitors; conversing with interviewees so
      that our answers where more qualitative and less static.</p>
    <h4>Online Survey</h4>
    <p>An online survey was created to gather additional quantitative information about people’s experiences when they
      previously visited. We gained a total of 25 responses. Based on the methods of data collection, half of the online
      survey questions were different from those in the interview. This survey helped us get a different audience from
      those we’ve interviewed in person, as most respondents weren’t frequent visitors.</p>
    <h4>Zoom Meeting</h4>
    <p>We did a group interview with Vancouver Art Gallery’s Director of Strategic Communications & Branding and
      Director
      of Publishing & Content Strategy. We dove into any concerns that they wanted us to look into, as well as some of
      their current and future goals.</p>

    <h2>Design Focus</h2>
    <h3>How might we create a sense of community and identity within the Vancouver Art Gallery that can be felt by
      regular
      and first-time visitors?</h3>

    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Because our research insight is centred on promoting exhibition marketing, our main targeted audience is frequent
      visitors with experience in artistic creation and first-time visitors. Frequent visitors are categorized as owners
      of memberships and visit 4~5 times a year. First-time visitors may come from other provinces who are interested in
      local art.</p>

    <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
    <p>Muhan assumed the responsibility of designing the journey map, while other team members contributed to the content
      creation. Based on our previous research and our personas, we mapped out the journey they may go through before,
      during and after their visit at Vancouver Art Gallery. We used these journeys to find pain points we could focus on
      and try to find the solution.</p>
