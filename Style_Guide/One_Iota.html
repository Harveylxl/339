    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <h3>Iota’s current software is only available on a web platform, which are more likely to be accessed after the game
      ends. However, we found that 0% of the players use a website to track their golf statistics and 82% of them track
      their performance while they play</h3>
    <p>How might we streamline the process of inputting data for competitive amateurs golfers to make golf performance
      tracking more efficient?</p>

    <h2>Opportunity</h2>
    <h3>We looked into portable technology because it allows golfers to input their golf performance more efficient
      during the play. We identified four opportunities from recording the golfers' performance with portable devices:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow golfers to efficiently enter data and voice note</li>
      <li>Preloads all the default golf course information to cut off golfers input time</li>
      <li>Measure golfers' mental health at the end of each hole</li>
      <li>Notify golfers and remind them to track their stats after they leave the current hole</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Process</h2>
    <p>Golf was an oblivious and obscure topic for us expect Christina. Our team spent 4 days conducting field study on
      golf through observing Christina's family play golf, interviewing key stakeholders, and conducting online
      research. According to our study, we straightened out the golf rules and the flow of playing golf.</p>
    <p>We kicked off the process with a comprehensive research phase - gathering quantitative data from online surveys.
      Surveys of 26 participants were conducted survey virtually.</p>

    <h3>Key Decision</h3>
    <p>After carefully analyzing the information provided by our client and considering the feedback obtained from our
      survey, we made a crucial design decision to simplify and clarify the visual representation of the golf app. This
      involved condensing the information into a more efficient, accessible, and portable version that met the needs of
      our participants. Moreover, based on this finding, we decided to shift our focus from creating a smartwatch app to
      developing a mobile app that offers greater accessibility.</p>
