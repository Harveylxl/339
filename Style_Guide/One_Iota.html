    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>One Iota Mobile is a mobile app that expands One Iota’s current website to help golfers track their key
      performance data while on course quickly and effectively.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <h3>Iota’s current software is only available on a web platform, which are more likely to be accessed after the game
      ends. However, we found that 0% of the players use a website to track their golf statistics and 82% of them track
      their performance while they play</h3>
    <p>How might we streamline the process of inputting data for competitive amateurs golfers to make golf performance
      tracking more efficient?</p>

    <h2>Research Process</h2>
    <p>Our team spent 4 days conducting field study on
      golf through observing Christina's family play golf, interviewing key stakeholders, and conducting online
      research. According to our study, we straightened out the golf rules and the flow of playing golf.</p>

    <h2>Key Decision</h2>
    <p>After carefully analyzing the information provided by our client and considering the feedback obtained from our
      survey, we made a crucial design decision to simplify and clarify the visual representation of the golf app. This
      involved condensing the information into a more efficient, accessible, and portable version that met the needs of
      our participants. </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h3>One Iota Mobile</h3>
    <p>Our solutions is to create a user-friendly and streamlined mobile app that prioritized ease-of-use and
      accessibility for golf enthusiasts of all skill levels to track their key performance data while on course quickly
      and effectively.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping and User testing</h2>
    <p>After finishing the initial mockup, I made a simple prototype with Figma for user testing. Christina recruited
      golfers from ​Vancouver Formosan Golf Club to finish user testing. The user testing also encouraged them to give
      more details about their user flow and habits for us to optimize the customization and functionality in One Iota
      Mobile.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Looking back on this project, if I had more time, I would like to explore
      more ways to improve and increase golfers engagements. Working on this project has been challenging but also very rewarding. Coming into this
      project, I had to make some design compromises. Part of being in a group project is to acknowledge and listen to
      everybody's ideas. This project taught me the importance of balancing users and client needs. Although this is
      a project that needs to provide a solution to the client, I as a UX designer need to make sure that the design
      is based on human-centered.</p>
